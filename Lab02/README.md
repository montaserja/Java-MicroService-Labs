##
1.	Create a new class that defines a random number with a value between 0-100.
    - if the number is greater than 50 – print “Big!”
    - if the number is less than 50 – print “Small!”
    - if the number equals to 50 – print “Bingo!”

##
2.	Create a new class that defines a random number with a value between 0-100.
    - if the value is between 0-50 – print “Small!”
    - else – print “Big!”
    - in addition:
        - if the value is even (can be divided by 2) – print “Even”
        - else – print “Odd”

##
3.	Create a new class named “SalaryRaiser”
    - define a random number named ‘salary’ with a value between 5000-6000.
    - print the current salary
    - Now, raise the salary:
        - By 10% - only if the result is not greater than 6000 (which is the maximum salary allowed)
        - By 5% - Otherwise.
    - print the updated salary

##
4.	Create a class that defines 3 random numbers and prints the bigger value

##
5.	Create a class that defines 3 random numbers and prints the smaller value

##
6.	Create a class named “TaxCalculator”
    - Salary taxes are calculated according to the following:
        - 0- 23,000 nis   tax rate is 10%
        - 23,000- 50,000 nis   tax rate is 20%
        - 50,000- 100,000 nis   tax rate is 30%
        - 100,000 - up nis   tax rate is 40%
    - that takes a random salary of an employee (randomize a value to be used as an input)
    - Print the salary before tax
    - Print the tax calculation
    - Print the salary after tax

##
7.	Bonus! - Implement the Tax Calculator Exercise this time with Differential Tax!

##
8.	Create a class that randomizes a value to present a year (like 970, 1990, 2010 …) and prints the year and if it is leap year or not.
- Leap year definition:
    - divide by 4 AND not divide by 100
    - divide by 400
